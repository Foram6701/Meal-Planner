# Meal-Planner
 This project is a Java-based Meal Planner that allows users to generate weekly meal plans, manage grocery lists, and get meal suggestions for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, with the ability to check off grocery items interactively. The project is a work-in-progress i.e. as I learn more, I will add more features to it
