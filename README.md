MEAL PLANNER:

This project is a Java-based Meal Planner that enables users to generate weekly meal plans, manage grocery lists, and get meal suggestions for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, all with an interactive system to check off grocery items. The project is a work-in-progress, and I plan to add more features as I learn and grow. I created this application to solve my personal challenge of spending too much time deciding what to eat, checking groceries, and making grocery lists. This program eliminates the hassle of manually planning meals, thinking of ideas, and preparing a weekly grocery list. Whenever Iâ€™m hungry, I can rely on the program to suggest meals, generate a grocery list, and help ensure I have all the necessary ingredients ready to cook.

- Generate a weekly meal plan with random breakfast, lunch, and dinner options for each day.
- Create and manage a grocery list based on selected meals.
- Get suggestions for breakfast, lunch, or dinner ideas from a predefined list of meals.
- Interactively check off grocery list items as they are procured.
